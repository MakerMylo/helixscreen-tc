/** Pure timing decisions for hold-to-repeat input.

 * executes one-shot timers). A press arms the machine; the owner then asks
 * on_elapsed() at whatever cadence it polls. No repeat fires before DELAY_MS,
 * then one fires per INTERVAL_MS. After release, swallow_click() says whether
 * the CLICKED that follows must be dropped: a hold that repeated must not add
 * one extra jog on release, while a plain tap with no repeat still jogs
 * exactly once via the existing click path.
